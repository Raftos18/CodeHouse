Users with the proper permission level (administrators and editors) have the ability to delete a post, page, and/or comments. When you delete the item, it is moved to the trash folder where it will remain for 30 days. This allows you, the user, to restore any item that you might have deleted accidentally. After 30 days, the item will be automatically and permanently deleted from your WordPress database. Trash functionality was added in WordPress 2.9 to reduce the chances of accidental deletion of items.","Category":"Web","Image":"https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/tana-mongeau4885/images/3/36/Photo.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20170412031044","Comments":[]}
